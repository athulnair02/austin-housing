# Homebase
A structured, comprehensive platform with co-created information to help University of Texas at Austin students find better off-campus housing options.

## Problems
Current West Campus housing has a lot of price instability that makes it difficult for students to time when they should sign their leases.
What may start of as a $850/mo lease at the beginning of the year can easily go to $1100/mo within a couple of weeks which adds tremendous stress to many students. 

In addition, there is a knowledge gap between different students. Some have older siblings or friends who can much better guide them through the process of signing a lease at a good location, while others could be first generation college students with no guidance in the process. 

Finally there is a lack of transparency between what apartments and students. Apartments know what previous prices were, what each tenant is paying, etc., all which future residents do not clearly know. Apartments also make it difficult to know current rates without having to visit the apartment and taking a tour: a expensive obstacle in terms of time considering the number of apartments to look at before making a decision.

## Solution
A platform to have west campus apartment information in one spot ready for students to access quickly and easily with all necessary information regarding an apartment. The feautues include data relevant to UT students, a discussion board, and an explore & filter search.

Apartments in west campus are listed on the platforms and students can filter these options based on factors they deem important: monthly rate, distance from key locations on campus, parking options, furnishing, etc. These relevant data points can help students find the housing choice that best fits for them. Once a aprtment is seleceted for further review, users can see a breakdown on the community's rating on how well the apartment performs in different criterias. Each apartment also has a list of their current offers and prices for different room arrangements. Finally, a discusion board offers a community area to discuss features of the apartment that stand out to them and could be key in others' decisions of finalizing their housing.

Each user has to input information on the apartment that they currently stay in upon signing up which will be pooled in a database where others can query the current prices an apartment offers their residents. This is the key feature that tackles the many problems of the current housing situation in west campus. Since students are offering their own pricing data into the platform, the price apartments list every leasing season after will fluctuate less as students can be more informed at what a reasonable price is for a unit and sign for units that do not overcharge their true market rate (not what the apartments claim it to be). Price instability and the lack of transparency therefore have no room to overwhelm students. The discussion board solves the knowledge gap as community knowledge on an apartment is shared publicy for others to absorb and make a rational, informed decision at the end.

## Technology
The front-end was built using React.js and works with the back-end database, Google's Firebase.

### Notes
This project was made under the UT Austin Convergent Organization.
This project has not been put into prouduction, but has won the Best Business Award for the 2021 Convergent Demo Day.
Altough it was a tumultuous journey for all our team members and we may not have been able to implement all features of our product, we definitely learned a lot about what processes happen to bring a product running and the logistics of creating a product.
